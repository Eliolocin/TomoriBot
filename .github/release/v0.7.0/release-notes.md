###  [TomoriBot Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=841644102059556915)
Please do not store sensitive memories into TomoriBot. **All API keys are encrypted but not memories.** 

Recommended to self-host your own TomoriBot in case I get phished by an e-mail claiming to be a Japanese cosplayer/tomboy/gamer girl asking for the database credentials.
*(insert more serious privacy reminder here in the future so I don't get burnt alive on a stake by my cybersec profs)*

### New Tomori Features
- **DM Feature** - You can now slide into Tomori's DMs for 1-on-1 convos
- **Link-Generated Embed Vision** - Tomori can now see text and image content within embeds generated from links sent on Discord such as Twitter post embeds
- Tomori now sees and understands when a message is sent as a reply to a different one in chat
- Secret easter egg string that allows you to gaslight TomoriBot into thinking a message is sent by herself
- **Natural stopping commands** - If Tomori is chatting and a "stop" trigger is sent in chat during it (eg. "chill" or "待って"), Tomori will stop yapping
### New Tools/MCPs for Tomori
- **Brave Search Tool** - faster than Google search, can search for Images and Videos as well which Tomori can send to chat
- **DuckDuckGo Search MCP Server** - fallback if Brave Search is not available
- **Profile Picture Recognition Tool** - allows Tomori to see your Discord avatar/profile picture
- **Pin Message Tool** - allows Tomori to pin messages in a channel, mods pin this abusable feature on the watchlist
- **YouTube Watch Tool** - allows Tomori to selectively watch YouTube video links
- **Link Fetching MCP Server** - fetches link contents as Markdown
### New Tomori Commands
- /respond - forces a response from TomoriBot (command execution is hidden from everyone so now you can annoy people with TomoriBot without exposing yourself, ~~might change later~~)
- /reason - forces a response from TomoriBot using a reasoning model of the current provider
- /language - changes your TomoriBot display language (swagapino in progress)
- /braveapi - for adding Brave Search API key, optional
### Smol Quality of Life
- Tomori no longer auto-processes youtube videos in chat that she isn't interested in, preventing token limits from being reached (thanks to YouTube watch tool)
- Tomori no longer has dementia that causes her to save a memory twice in a row
- Slash command modals now have descriptions and string selects
### Refactored
- Alot
- Tomori-chan preset personality is no longer tsundere to remove overlap with Tomori-san
